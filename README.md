# Flight Fare Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
Predicting flight ticket prices has always been challenging due to dynamic pricing influenced by various factors such as seasonality, demand, and airline policies. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical flight fare data and predict future ticket prices, helping both travelers and airlines optimize their planning.

Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices are highly volatile and often unpredictable. This project aims to:

Perform in-depth data analysis to identify factors influencing flight fares.
Develop a predictive model to forecast ticket prices based on input features such as airline, journey date, route, stops, and duration.
#Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and patterns in the flight fare dataset using essential analysis techniques.
Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model to accurately predict flight ticket prices.
Model Comparison: Evaluate multiple machine learning models and recommend the most efficient one for production use.
Challenges & Solutions: Address challenges encountered during the analysis and model-building phases.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:

Airline: The airline operating the flight.
Date_of_Journey: The journey's start date.
Source: Departure location.
Destination: Arrival location.
Route: Path taken by the flight.
Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.
Duration: Flight duration.
Total_Stops: Number of stops during the flight.
Additional_Info: Miscellaneous information (e.g., meal preferences, amenities).
Price: Total cost of the ticket.

Results
The best-performing model is [Your Chosen Model], achieving the following metrics:
MAE: [Value]
RMSE: [Value]
R² Score: [Value]
Key insights from EDA:
Prices tend to increase for specific airlines and during peak seasons.
Non-stop flights generally have higher fares compared to flights with stops.
Challenges Faced
Handling Missing Values: Addressed using imputation techniques for missing or inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features from date and time attributes.
Model Overfitting: Mitigated by using regularization techniques and cross-validation.
Future Scope
Expand the dataset with real-time pricing information for better accuracy.
Develop a web application to make price predictions user-friendly.
Integrate dynamic pricing features to account for seasonal and demand variations.
